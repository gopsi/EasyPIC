# Making PIC Development Easy
--- PROJECT STILL IN DEVELOPMENT ---
The EasyPIC project is an attempt to make working with the Microchip application libraries much easier. The idea originally came from my struggles in getting the Microchip TCP/IP stack working on a PIC18 and then repeating the challenge on a PIC32.  The EasyPIC libraries use an opinionated approach to creating a project using PIC microcontrollers that should help beginners get their projects compiling and working quickly while learning all of the necessary pieces that go into creating a project from scratch.  Although targeted mainly to beginners in PIC development, experienced PIC developers may find the libraries useful as well.

## Requirements

### Microchip Microcontroller
The libraries are designed to work with the Microchip PIC microcontrollers

### Compiler From Microchip
The libraries assume you are using one of the compilers available from Microchip.  While the code can be adapted to work with any compiler, the main effort of this project focuses on the tools available from Microchip.

## Getting Started
* Creating your first project with the EasyPIC libraries (Link to be created soon)

## Questions and Support
* **General Support** is currently being handled by me.  Feel free to email me, leave a comment on [my blog](http://sidwar.com), or send me a message via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sidwarkd) or [Facebook](https://facebook.com/kevin.sidwar).
* **Bugs** in the EasyPIC libraries can be reported using the [issues tracker](https://github.com/sidwarkd/EasyPIC/issues).   
Please provide as much details about your test setup as possible (device, modules used, etc).  
* **Feature Requests** can also be posted to the [issues tracker](https://github.com/sidwarkd/EasyPIC/issues).
