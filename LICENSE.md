##Microchip License

A version of that agreement is included in this project but is not guaranteed to be current.  Refer to [Microchip's Website](http://www.microchip.com) for the most current version.  **NOTE:** Downloading the EasyPIC project entirely or in part constitutes your agreement to be bound by the Microchip Application Solutions Users Agreement as it pertains to code distributed my Microchip and used in the EasyPIC project.

##Changes to Microchip Code
In order to integrate the Microchip Application Library code into the EasyPIC project some changes were made to source and header files from Microchip.  All changes are in compliance with the Microchip Application Solutions Users Agreement and are clearly commented in the files in which the changes were made.
